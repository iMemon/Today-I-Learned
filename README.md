## Inspiration
Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and first
learned from
[7 Habits I Wish Every (Junior) Programmer Should Have](https://medium.com/@shekhargulati/7-habits-i-wish-every-junior-programmer-should-have-d0d6d8a972c9#.s4lq904g9).

## Contributing

The best way you can contribute is to support the idea of keeping track of things you learned. Just create a public repo and start writing and sharing notes. This is way better than keeping them to yourself.
